## Project Overview:
This project aims to provide a platform for displaying driver's exam statistics in Macedonia. The website, hosted at [vozackiispiti.mk](https://vozackiispiti.netlify.app/), offers valuable insights into driver's exam results, contributing to transparency and awareness.

## Data Processing:
The website processes hashed information to generate statistics related to driver's exam results. It's important to note that no personally identifiable information is stored or processed in its original form. The hashing mechanism (sha256) is employed to protect the privacy of individuals, ensuring that the statistics are derived from anonymized and aggregated data.
